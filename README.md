# GameAI Studio

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is my submission for the **🎮 GameForge AI: Build the Future of Game Creation** hackathon. The goal is to revolutionize how games are made by building an AI-powered system that helps creators rapidly design, prototype, and optimize games — all while maintaining professional quality.

## 🏗️ What This Project Does

- **AI-Assisted Asset Library:** Quickly generate and manage visual assets for your games using AI.
- **Intuitive UI:** Modern, responsive interface for browsing, searching, and using assets.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Tools and workflows designed to reduce time-to-prototype for game creators.
- **Quality Output:** Ensures assets and modules are production-ready and consistent.
